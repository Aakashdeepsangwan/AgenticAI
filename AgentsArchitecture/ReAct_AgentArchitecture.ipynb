      "content='' additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'Okay, the user is asking how machine learning is used in AI. Let me start by understanding the question. They want to know the connection between machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), specifically the applications or methods where ML contributes to AI.\\n\\nFirst, I should define both terms. AI is the broader concept of machines performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, like visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, etc. Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves algorithms learning patterns from data. So ML is a part of AI, but not all AI uses ML. However, in recent years, ML has become a significant component of AI systems.\\n\\nNow, to explain how ML is used in AI, I can think of several areas. For example, in natural language processing (NLP), ML algorithms like neural networks are used to enable machines to understand and generate human language. In computer vision, ML models are trained to recognize patterns in images and videos. Reinforcement learning is another area where ML agents learn by interacting with an environment, which is used in robotics and game playing.\\n\\nI should also mention specific applications like recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis. These examples show practical uses of ML within AI. Additionally, it\\'s important to note that ML allows AI systems to improve over time by learning from data, making them more accurate and efficient without being explicitly programmed for each task.\\n\\nWait, but I need to make sure the information is accurate. Maybe I should verify some of these points using the available tools. The user provided functions for arxiv, wikipedia, and tavily_search. Since the question is about general applications, Wikipedia might have a good overview. Let me check the Wikipedia function. The parameters require a query, so I could search for \"Machine learning in artificial intelligence\" or similar. Alternatively, arxiv might have recent papers on the topic, but since the user is asking for a general explanation, Wikipedia might be more suitable here.\\n\\nI should also consider if there are any common misconceptions to address. For instance, some people might think all AI uses ML, but that\\'s not the case. Traditional AI systems might use rule-based programming without ML. However, modern AI heavily relies on ML techniques, especially with the availability of large datasets.\\n\\nAnother point is the different types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning. Each type is applied in AI in different ways. Supervised learning is used when labeled data is available, unsupervised for finding hidden patterns, and reinforcement learning for decision-making processes.\\n\\nI need to structure the answer clearly. Start by stating the relationship between ML and AI, then outline the key areas where ML is applied in AI, provide examples, and perhaps mention the types of ML involved. Also, highlight the importance of data in ML for AI\\'s effectiveness.\\n\\nWait, should I use the tavily_search function to get more up-to-date information? The user mentioned it\\'s optimized for current events. But the question isn\\'t time-sensitive. The relationship between ML and AI is a general concept, so maybe Wikipedia is sufficient. However, to ensure comprehensiveness, checking a search engine might provide additional examples. But since the tools are available, perhaps querying \"Applications of machine learning in artificial intelligence\" on Wikipedia would be efficient.\\n\\nLet me proceed to use the Wikipedia function with that query. That should give a reliable source for the information.\\n', 'tool_calls': [{'id': '6t9d1w43h', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"query\":\"Applications of machine learning in artificial intelligence\"}', 'name': 'wikipedia'}, 'type': 'function'}]} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 715, 'prompt_tokens': 597, 'total_tokens': 1312, 'completion_time': 1.535210992, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 685}, 'prompt_time': 0.03359587, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.077036063, 'total_time': 1.568806862}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_d58dbe76cd', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'} id='lc_run--019ba98d-5657-71d1-aede-90d4d268153d-0' tool_calls=[{'name': 'wikipedia', 'args': {'query': 'Applications of machine learning in artificial intelligence'}, 'id': '6t9d1w43h', 'type': 'tool_call'}] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 597, 'output_tokens': 715, 'total_tokens': 1312, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 685}}\n"

AI did not. The first week of 2026 has delivered one of the most consequential news cycles in recent memory: NVIDIA unveiled Vera Rubin at CES, redefining what an AI platform even means. Meta closed a $2 billion acquisition of Manus, signaling that the race is now about agentic execution at scale, not just model performance. AMD positioned itself as the credible second source for enterprise inference. And the Model Context Protocol moved into the Linux Foundation, beginning the standardization of how agents interact with everything. [...] Meanwhile, two infrastructure stories emerged that will shape everything else: power constraints are becoming the primary bottleneck for AI scale, with data centers facing conditional access to the grid. And OpenAI formally conceded what security researchers have known for years: prompt injection is a permanent feature of the agentic landscape, not a bug to be patched.\\n\\nStepping back, three themes are defining 2026’s starting position: the hardware competition is shifting from chips to complete systems; agent security has entered a permanent arms race; and the winners will be whoever makes AI infrastructure boring, reliable, and governable.\\n\\n## Top Stories This Week\", \"score\": 0.94289196}, {\"title\": \"Latest AI News and AI Breakthroughs that Matter Most: 2026 & 2025\", \"url\": \"https://www.crescendo.ai/news/latest-ai-news-and-updates\", \"content\": \"Source:Bloomberg ↗\\n\\n### Samsung to Expand AI Presence with 800 Million Gemini-Powered Devices\\n\\nDate: January 5, 2026\\n\\nSummary: Samsung Electronics has announced an ambitious goal to double its footprint of mobile devices equipped with Google’s Gemini AI, aiming for 800 million units by the end of 2026. This massive expansion will bring advanced generative AI features, previously reserved for flagship models, to a wider range of mid-tier and budget smartphones and tablets. The move solidifies the deep strategic partnership between Samsung and Google as they compete to set the industry standard for on-device AI experiences, focusing on real-time translation, sophisticated image editing, and proactive digital assistance across the global Android ecosystem.\\n\\nSource:Reuters ↗ [...] Source:Bloomberg ↗\\n\\n### Boston Dynamics Utilizes AI to Train Humanoid Robots for Industrial Roles\\n\\nDate: January 4, 2026\\n\\nSummary: Boston Dynamics is significantly advancing the capabilities of its humanoid robots by integrating reinforcement learning and large-scale AI training to prepare them for real-world labor. In a recent demonstration, the company showcased its new fully electric Atlas model performing complex, autonomous tasks such as moving automotive parts in a factory setting. Unlike previous iterations that relied on rigid programming, these new AI-driven humanoids can adapt to shifting environments and unexpected obstacles. The initiative reflects a strategic push toward deploying robots in commercial industries to handle repetitive or hazardous jobs alongside human workers. [...] Date: January 5, 2026\\n\\nSummary: During its CES 2026 keynote, NVIDIA officially unveiled its latest flagship AI platform, codenamed \\\"Vera Rubin.\\\" Following the Blackwell architecture, the Rubin platform introduces radical improvements in processing power and memory bandwidth, specifically engineered to handle the massive scaling requirements of trillion-parameter models.
